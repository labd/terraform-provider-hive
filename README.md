# GraphQL Hive Terraform Provider

The Terraform GraphQL Hive provider allows you to configure your [GraphQL Hive](https://graphql-hive.com/) project with infrastructure-as-code principles.

# Commercial support

Need support implementing this terraform provider in your organization? Or are you missing features 
that need to be added, then we are able to offer support. Please contact us at opensource@labdigital.nl

# Quick start

[Read our documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/labd/hive/latest/docs)
and check out the examples in the [examples](./examples) directory.

## Usage

The provider is distributed via the Terraform registry. To use it you need to configure
the [`required_providers`](https://www.terraform.io/language/providers/requirements#requiring-providers) block. For example:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    hive = {
      source = "labd/hive"

      # It's recommended to pin the version, e.g.:
      # version = "~> 1.0.0"
    }
  }
}

data "hive_schema_check" "my-service" {
  project = "my-project"
  target  = "my-target"
  service = "my-service"
  schema  = file("schema.graphql")
}

resource "hive_schema_check" "my-service" {
  project = "my-project"
  target  = "my-target"
  service = "my-service"
  commit  = "57ee05c"
  schema  = file("schema.graphql")
}

resource "hive_schema_publish" "my-service" {
  project = "my-project"
  target  = "my-target"
  service = "my-service"
  commit  = "57ee05c"
  url     = "https://checkout.example.com/graphql"
  schema  = file("schema.graphql")
}

resource "hive_app_create" "persisted_documents" {
  name      = "site"
  version   = "1.0.0"
  documents = file("persisted_documents.json")
}

resource "hive_app_publish" "persisted_documents" {
  name      = "site"
  version   = "1.0.0"
}
```

# Binaries

Packages of the releases are available at
https://github.com/labd/terraform-provider-hive/releases See the
[terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#third-party-plugins)
for more information about installing third-party providers.

# Contributing

## Requirements

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.24
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/)
- [Changie](https://github.com/miniscruff/changie)

## Building the provider

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/labd/terraform-provider-hive`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/labd; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/labd
$ git clone git@github.com:labd/terraform-provider-hive
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/labd/terraform-provider-hive
$ task build-local
```

A build is created `terraform-provider-hive_99.0.0` in the root directory and added to plugin folder available
locally:

```sh
~/.terraform.d/plugins/registry.terraform.io/labd/hive/99.0.0/${OS_ARCH}/terraform-provider-hive_v99.0.0
```

Use version `99.0.0` in the provider to test your changes locally

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    hive = {
      source  = "labd/hive"
      version = "99.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

## Debugging / Troubleshooting

There are two environment settings for troubleshooting:

- `TF_LOG=INFO` enables debug output for Terraform.
- `HIVE_DEBUG=1` enables debug output for the GraphQL Hive GO SDK this provider uses.

Note this generates a lot of output!

## Releasing

When creating a PR with changes, please include a changie file in the `changelogs/unreleased` folder. This file can be
interactively generated by running `changie new` in the root of the project. Pick a suitable category for the change. We
recommend `Fixed` or `Added` for most cases.

Once a new version is released, all the unreleased changelog files will be merged and added to the general CHANGELOG.md file.

## Testing

### Running the unit tests

```sh
$ task test
```

### Running the unit tests with coverage

```sh
$ task coverage
```
